## Usage 

When you arrive on the landing page, you will see a brief desciption of the website as well as a get started button. When you click the button, the page will redirect you to another page housing the main features of the site. There are 2 areas where you can enter both a title and description of the note. Afterwards you will press the square-like save icon. If you wish to create or overwrite what is currently inside those areas, you can press the pensil icon. Once save is pressed, a note will appear on the left hand side of the page displaying the title of the note you saved. They may stack and duplicates are allowed. When you press on the text of one of those notes, the 2 fields will be populates with that notes title and description, editing is not allowed yet. When you want to delete a note you may press the trash can icon next to it.
